This document explains the fields of the Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) Extension to the
[SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec) (STAC) specification.

SAR data is considered to be data that represents a snapshot of the earth for a single date and time taken by a synthetic-aperture radar system 
such as Sentinel-1, RADARSAT or EnviSAT.

If the data has been collected by a satellite, it is strongly recommended to use the 
[`sat` extension](https://github.com/stac-extensions/sat). 
If the data has been collected on an airborne platform it is strongly recommended to use the 
[Instrument Fields](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/tree/master/item-spec/common-metadata.md#instrument).

To describe frame start and end times, use the
[Date and Time Range fields](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/tree/master/item-spec/common-metadata.md#date-and-time-range).

- Examples:
  - [Envisat](examples/envisat.json)
  - [Sentinel-1](examples/sentinel-1.json)
- [JSON Schema](json-schema/schema.json)
- [Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md)

## Item Properties or Asset Fields

| Field Name                  | Type      | Description                                                  |
| --------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| sar:instrument_mode         | string    | **REQUIRED.** The name of the sensor acquisition mode that is commonly used. This should be the short name, if available. For example, `WV` for "Wave mode" of Sentinel-1 and Envisat ASAR satellites. |
| sar:frequency_band          | string    | **REQUIRED.** The common name for the frequency band to make it easier to search for bands across instruments. See section "Common Frequency Band Names" for a list of accepted names. |
| sar:center_frequency        | number    | The center frequency of the instrument, in gigahertz (GHz). |
| sar:polarizations           | \[string] | **REQUIRED.** Any combination of polarizations. |
| sar:product_type            | string    | **REQUIRED.** The product type, for example `SSC`, `MGD`, or `SGC` |
| sar:resolution_range        | number    | The range resolution, which is the maximum ability to distinguish two adjacent targets perpendicular to the flight path, in meters (m).  |
| sar:resolution_azimuth      | number    | The azimuth resolution, which is the maximum ability to distinguish two adjacent targets parallel to the flight path, in meters (m).  |
| sar:pixel_spacing_range     | number    | The range pixel spacing, which is the distance between adjacent pixels perpendicular to the flight path, in meters (m). Strongly RECOMMENDED to be specified for products of type `GRD`. |
| sar:pixel_spacing_azimuth   | number    | The azimuth pixel spacing, which is the distance between adjacent pixels parallel to the flight path, in meters (m). Strongly RECOMMENDED to be specified for products of type `GRD`. |
| sar:looks_range             | number    | Number of range looks, which is the number of groups of signal samples (looks) perpendicular to the flight path. |
| sar:looks_azimuth           | number    | Number of azimuth looks, which is the number of groups of signal samples (looks) parallel to the flight path. |
| sar:looks_equivalent_number | number    | The equivalent number of looks (ENL). |
| sar:observation_direction   | string    | Antenna pointing direction relative to the flight trajectory of the satellite, either `left` or `right`. |

**Note:** In this specification *range* values are meant to be measured perpendicular to the flight path and *azimuth* values 
are meant to be measured parallel to the flight path.

### Additional Field Information

#### sar:polarizations

Specifies a single polarization or a polarization combination. For single polarized radars one of 
`HH`, `VV`, `HV` or `VH` must be set. Fully polarimetric radars add all four polarizations to the array. 
Dual polarized radars and alternating polarization add the corresponding polarizations to the array, 
for instance for `HH+HV` add both `HH` and `HV`.

**Important:** In the `properties` of a STAC Item `sar:polarizations` must be a set with unique elements. 
In assets `sar:polarizations` can contain duplicate elements and, if possible, the polarizations must appear in the same order as in the file.

#### sar:product_type

The product type defines the type of processed data contained in the assets. A list of suggestions include:

| sar:product_type  | Type      | Description |
| ----------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| SSC               | complex   | Single-look Slant-range Complex image (standard SLC) |
| MGD               | amplitude | Multilooked Ground-range Detected image |
| GRD               | amplitude | Multilooked Ground-range Detected image (used by Sentinel-1) |
| GEC               | amplitude | Geocoded Ellipsoid Corrected image |
| GTC               | amplitude | Geocoded Terrain Corrected image |
| RTC               | amplitude | Geocoded Radiometrically Terrain Corrected image |
| SGC               | complex   | Single-look Ground projected Complex image |
| SLC               | complex   | Single-look Ground projected Complex image (used by Sentinel-1) |

This can vary by data provider, who all may use slightly different names. Sentinel-1 for instance uses `GRD`, which is the same as the more general `MGD` and `SLC` instead of `SGC`. 

### Common Frequency Band Names

The `sar:frequency_band` is the name that is commonly used to refer to that band's spectral
properties. The table below shows the common name based on the wavelength and frequency ranges for several SAR satellites.

| Common Name | Wavelength Range (cm) | Frequency Range (GHz) | Satellites |
| ----------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | ---------- |
| P           | 30 - 120              | 0.25 - 1              | |
| L           | 15 - 30               | 1 - 2                 | ALOS, JERS, NISAR, SOACOM |
| S           | 7.5 - 15              | 2 - 4                 | HJ-1C |
| C           | 3.8 - 7.5             | 4 - 8                 | EnviSat, ERS, Radarsat, Risat-1, Sentinel-1 |
| X           | 2.4 - 3.8             | 8 - 12.5              | Cosmo-SkyMed, TerraSAR-X, RanDEM-X, PAZ, KOMPSat-5 |
| Ku          | 1.7 - 2.4             | 12.5 - 18             | |
| K           | 1.1 - 1.7             | 18 - 26.5             | |
| Ka          | 0.75 - 1.1            | 26.5 - 40             | |

### Date and Time

In SAR, you usually have frame start and end time. To describe this information it is recommended to use the [Date and Time Range fields](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/tree/master/item-spec/common-metadata.md#date-and-time-range).
The center time of the frame should be specified with the `datetime` property for STAC Items.

## Best Practices

One of the emerging best practices is to use [Asset Roles](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/tree/master/item-spec/item-spec.md#asset-roles) 
to provide clients with more information about the assets in an item. The following list includes a shared vocabulary for some common SAR assets. 
This list should not be considered definitive, and implementors are welcome to use other asset roles. If consensus and tooling consolidates around 
these role names then they will be specified in the future as more standard than just 'best practices'.

| Role Name | Description                                                            |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| local-incidence-angle | Points to the local incidence angle file. |
| ellipsoid-incidence-angle | Points to the ellipsoid incidence angle file. |
| noise-power | Points to the noise power file. |
| amplitude | Points to the intensity file with focused SAR data that has been ground range detected (e.g. GRD). |
| magnitude | Points to the intensity file where data are represented as complex numbers containing amplitude and phase information (e.g SLC). |
| sigma0 | Points to the radar backscatter file where data is referenced in ground surface. It is often derived from an `amplitude` or a `magnitude` role asset. |
| beta0 | Points to the radar backscatter file where data is referenced in the slant range plane and is radiometrically calibrated.  It is often derived from an `amplitude` or a `magnitude` role asset. |
| gamma0 | Points to the radar backscatter file where data is referenced in the plane perpendicular to the line of sight. It is often derived from an `amplitude` or a `magnitude` role asset. |
| date-offset | Points to the date-offset file. |
| covmat | Points to the Points to the Normalized Polarimetric Radar Covariance Matrix (CovMat) file. |
| prd | Points to the Polarimetric Radar Decomposition (PRD) file. |

## Contributing

All contributions are subject to the
[STAC Specification Code of Conduct](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
For contributions, please follow the
[STAC specification contributing guide](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) Instructions
for running tests are copied here for convenience.

### Running tests

The same checks that run as checks on PR's are part of the repository and can be run locally to verify that changes are valid. 
To run tests locally, you'll need `npm`, which is a standard part of any [node.js installation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

First you'll need to install everything with npm once. Just navigate to the root of this repository and on 
your command line run:
```bash
npm install
```

Then to check markdown formatting and test the examples against the JSON schema, you can run:
```bash
npm test
```

This will spit out the same texts that you see online, and you can then go and fix your markdown or examples.

If the tests reveal formatting problems with the examples, you can fix them with:
```bash
npm run format-examples
```
